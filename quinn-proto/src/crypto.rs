//! Traits and implementations for the QUIC cryptography protocol
//!
//! The protocol logic in Quinn is contained in types that abstract over the actual
//! cryptographic protocol used. This module contains the traits used for this
//! abstraction layer as well as a single implementation of these traits that uses
//! *ring* and rustls to implement the TLS protocol support.
//!
//! Note that usage of any protocol (version) other than TLS 1.3 does not conform to any
//! published versions of the specification, and will not be supported in QUIC v1.
